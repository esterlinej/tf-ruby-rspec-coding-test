# CodingTest

A quick way to get a look at someone's approach to coding.
Test Driven Development. I give you the tests, and you make them pass.

## Instructions

 1. Clone your repository onto your local computer 
 3. Implement the code to get the specs passing
 4. Commit your changes
 5. Use `git format-patch HEAD` to store your commits (use `HEAD~` for 2 commits, `HEAD~~` for 3, etc) 
 6. Email the patch file(s) to the person who pointed you to this project (or me: titusfortner@gmail.com).
